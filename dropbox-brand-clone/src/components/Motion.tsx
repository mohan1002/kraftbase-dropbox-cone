            <h2>Motion Design Principles</h2>
            <p>
                Our motion design is guided by the principles of clarity, purpose, and delight. 
                We use motion to enhance the user experience, providing feedback and guiding users 
                through interactions.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Motion should clarify the relationship between elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Every motion should have a reason and enhance usability.</li>
                <li><strong>Delight:</strong> Use motion to create a joyful experience for users.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Examples of Motion Usage</h3>
            <p>
                - Transitions between states should be smooth and intuitive.<br />
                - Use subtle animations to draw attention to important actions.<br />
                - Ensure that motion is not distracting and maintains focus on the content.
