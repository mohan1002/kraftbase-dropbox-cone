            <h2>Imagery Guidelines</h2>
            <p>
                Our imagery should reflect the brand's values and resonate with our audience. 
                Use high-quality images that are relevant and engaging. 
                Ensure that the imagery aligns with our overall brand aesthetic.
            </p>
            <h3>Photography Style</h3>
            <p>
                We prefer natural, candid photography that showcases real people and authentic moments. 
                Avoid overly staged or artificial images.
            </p>
            <h3>Illustration Style</h3>
            <p>
                Illustrations should be simple, clean, and complement our photography. 
                Use a limited color palette that aligns with our brand colors.
            </p>
            <h3>Image Usage</h3>
            <p>
                Always ensure that images are used in a way that enhances the content and does not distract from it. 
                Maintain consistency in style and tone across all imagery.
